# collatz-conjecture
Based off of Collatz's Conjecture, try your own positive input to disprove the conjecture by reaching zero or less 


Collatz Conjecture

-Any positive integer fed into the Collatz's Conjecture will always end up in a 4-2-1 infinite loop

-When the integer is even, divide by two
-When the integer is odd, multiply by 3 and then add 1

-Feed the results back into the function until....
a.) you reach the 4-2-1 trap
b.) or you disprove Collatz's Conjecture by reaching 0 or a negative number



Example:     5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
